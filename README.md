# Quickdoc

## API docs

See [API.md](API.md).

## Rationale

This library came out of the desire to have a fast and light weight tool that
works on any Clojure code (`.clj`, `.cljs`, `.cljc`, `.cljd`), without executing
that code. This tool produces pure Markdown and the output does not need CSS or
JavaScript.

Quickdoc's properties:

- Based on [clj-kondo static analysis](https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo/tree/master/analysis)
- Fast using [babashka]
